# I'm Jananadi.

I'm a software engineer by practice, Lately, I'm tinkering and building tools for an effient workflow while experimenting with my creativity. Since AI has taken half of my software engineer job, I'm also working on product, UI/UX design.

Recently, I moved to San Francisco from Malta (EU), to give my wild tech dreams a shot.

- Recently pivoted to live networking events, building a platform to suggest top people to meet at events.
- Freelance front-end lead (product) at [Daxe AI](https://daxe.ai/) — a legal-tech startup

## Previously

## Background

I'm originally from Sri Lanka. Moved to South Korea when i was quite young and lived there for 10 years. I studied at Hanseo University, then worked for startups in diverse industries for 6 years.

## Outside of work

I sketch and draw everyday things [here](https://canvasconfetti.art/), read, hike, or travel.

## Fun fact

I'm fluent in Korean, Sinhala and English. I've always been a nomad — moved across two continents (asia, europe and now in north america), four countries(lived in Sri Lanka, South Korea, Malta and now USA), starting everything from scratch, three times.
