# I'm Jananadi.

I'm a software engineer by practice, transitioning into a systems-first engineer, learning AI/ML. Since AI has taken half of my software engineer job, I'm also working on product design.

Recently, I moved to San Francisco from Malta (EU), to give my wild tech dreams a shot.

## Currently

- Building [LinkMap](https://linkmap.app/) — where heavy connections can be managed and nurtured
- Freelance front-end lead (product) at [Daxe AI](https://daxe.ai/) — a legal-tech startup

## Previously

- Full-stack engineer at [Rocketfin](https://www.rocketfin.io/) building fin-tech tools for [Taula Capital](https://www.taulacapital.com/) (UK), based in Malta as a digital nomad
- Front-end engineer at [Tokamak Network](https://www.tokamak.network/) and [ONDA](https://www.onda.me/) building SaaS products in South Korea
- Backend engineer at [Corners](https://www.corners.co.kr/) in IoT safety tech

## Background

Moved from Sri Lanka to South Korea, called it home for about 10 years. Studied, then worked for startups in diverse industries.

## Outside of work

I sketch everyday things [here](https://canvasconfetti.art/), read, hike, or travel.

## Fun fact

I speak fluent Korean. I've always been a nomad — moved across two continents, four countries, starting everything from scratch, three times.
